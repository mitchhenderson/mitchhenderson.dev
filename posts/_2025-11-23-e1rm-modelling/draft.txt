I've defined the "squad" (30 athletes) to have a mean 1RM of 140 and standard deviation of 20 drawn from a random normal distribution. I also assign them an **endurance ability** (also from normal distribution).

Each athlete will have data from somewhere between 5 and 30 previous training sessions where they've done this exercises til failure.

For each of these max rep sets, the athletes complete somewhere between 2 and 15 reps. I calculate a theoretical weight for the set using the simulated 1RM and reps based on a modified version of the Epley formula (arguably most commonly used, modified to account for endurance ability).

Finally, I simulate the actual weight they lifted for the set by taking the weight they theoretically could lift given their simulated 1RM and reps, added some random noise (because humans just work like that) from a negative skew-normal distribution. I chose negative skew-normal instead of regular normal because I think there's a lot more reasons why an athlete can be down from their theoretical 1RM level on any given day (fatigue, injury, soreness, environment, etc) than above it (strength adaptation). This means that on most days, what they've lifted will be a bit less than what the 1RM formula predicts they could.
