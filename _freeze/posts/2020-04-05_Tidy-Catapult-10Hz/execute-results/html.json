This post shows you how to tidy it using R.\n---\n\n\n# YouTube tutorial\n\nYou can see me going through all the steps outlined here in this video with some dummy data (note that I've simplified the file structure in the post since recording this video so it will be a little different; both work though):\n\n\n{{< video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0DCRqqSKPw&t=32s >}}\n\n\n\n# Tidy data\n\nIt's claimed that \\~80% of data analysis is on the process of cleaning and preparing the data [(1)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/book/10.1002/0471448354). In 2014, [Hadley Wickham](https://twitter.com/hadleywickham) coined the term [tidy data](https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf) to define a dataset structured to facilitate analysis. In the [R for Data Science book's section on tidy data](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html), for a dataset to be *tidy* it has to follow these 3 interrelated rules:\n\n1.  Each variable must have its own column.\n2.  Each observation must have its own row.\n3.  Each value must have it's own cell.\n\n![](/img/tidy_data.png) *Following three rules makes a dataset tidy: variables are in columns, observations are in rows, and values are in cells.

Each unit has produced it's own `.csv` file, meaning to do any analysis using all players' data we need to find a way to combine the files.\n2.  There are 8 rows of metadata above the actual data we're primarily interested in, preventing us from combining in it's current format.\n\nWithout combining all players' data into one *tidy* table or \"*dataframe*\", we can't explore the data using the common tools like a PivotTable on Microsoft Excel or the `dplyr` R package.\n\n# Solution\n\nThankfully for us, we don't need to manually go through each file, deleting the top 8 rows, creating new columns for the metadata like player name and match, and then copy pasting them all into the one file. The `tidyverse` suite of R packages can help us to largely automate these manual tasks!\n\n![](/img/batman_thinking.gif)\n\nI'll explain how to do it here (and provide you with the R code), and a working example is in [the YouTube video above](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0DCRqqSKPw&t=11s).\n\nThis process will:\n\n1.  Pull in each `.csv` file's data within the folder you've referenced with the `folder_name` variable (assuming that folder is within your working directory).\n2.  Remove the 8 rows of metadata from the top of each file.\n3.  Create new columns for player name and activity derived from the `.csv`'s file name generated by Openfield.\n4.  Combine all files into one *dataframe*.\n5.  Export this dataframe into a new `.csv` called \"`folder_name`\\_tidy.csv\" in your working directory. Where the `folder_name` part of the new file name is a folder in your working directory where your exports are stored (e.g., the name of my file below is \"combine_tidy.csv\" because I have my `.csv` files in a folder called \"combine\"). You will type in the name of this folder into the code.\n\n![](/img/batcomputer.gif)\n\n## Step 1\n\nCreate a folder that will contain all your folders of Openfield 10Hz exports. Name this anything you like.\n\nThis folder will need to be in your working directory when you run the code below. If you aren't familiar with a working directory, it is just a file path on your computer that sets the default location of any files you read into R, or save out of R. Think of it like a \"home\" folder and you refer to all files relative to this (you can check what it's currently set to by running `getwd()`. I recommend using [RStudio Projects](https://rfortherestofus.com/2022/10/rstudio-projects/ \"Why You Should Always Use RStudio Projects by R for the Rest of Us\") to make this process much smoother.\n\nIn my code below I've assigned the variable `folder_name` to be \"combine\" (the name of my folder that I will save the export files). **You will need to change the `folder_name` variable to the folder that will contain your export files**.\n\n## Step 2\n\nExport the files you'd like to combine from Openfield **without changing their filename** and save them in the folder discussed in Step 1.\n\nSome examples could be \"Round 1\" if you're combining all your athletes exports from a round 1 match.\n\n## Step 3\n\nMake sure you have [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) downloaded and installed on your machine (both free!).\n\nOpen RStudio, copy and paste the code below into a script (you can create a new R script by clicking the symbol directly under 'File' on the top-left of the window, and selecting 'R Script').\n\nSave the file as a `.R` file with an appropriate name (e.g. \"tidy_catapult_data.R\").\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Script to combine and tidy multiple Catapult Openfield 10Hz export .csv files by Mitch Henderson\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(zoo)\n\n# This must exactly match the folder name containing the .csv files and be in your working directory\n\nfolder_name <- \"combine\"\n\n# This function will read in multiple .csv files, create a column with the file name, and parse it into it's relevant components.\n\nread_plus <- function(flnm) {\n  read_csv(flnm, skip = 8) |>\n    mutate(Filename = flnm,\n           without_folder = str_split(Filename, \"/\")[[1]][2],\n           Activity = str_split(without_folder, \" Export\")[[1]][1],\n           Player_interim = str_split(without_folder, \" for \")[[1]][2],\n           Player = paste0(\n             str_split(Player_interim, \" \")[[1]][1],\n             \" \",\n             str_split(Player_interim, \" \")[[1]][2]\n             )\n           ) |>\n  select(-Filename,\n         -Player_interim,\n         -without_folder)\n}\n\n# Import all files contained within the folder specified by `folder_name` above\n\ncombine_and_tidy <-\n  list.files(path = paste0(folder_name, \"/\"),\n             pattern = \"*.csv\", \n             full.names = T) |>\n  map_df(~read_plus(.))\n\n# Output csv into working directory\n\nwrite.csv(combine_and_tidy, file = paste0(folder_name, \"_tidy.csv\"), row.names = F)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Step 4\n\nChange the `folder_name` variable to the exact folder name (in double quotes like is currently in the code) containing the `.csv` files you would like to combine and tidy.\n\nHighlight the entire code and press Ctrl + Enter on PC or Cmd + Return on a Mac. This will run the code and produce the output `.csv` file in your working directory.\n\n**Done!**\n\nNow the data is in *tidy* format and is easy to manipulate and analyse!\n\n![](/img/tidy_gps.png)\n\n![](/img/batman_thumbsup.gif)\n\nLet me know if this post has helped you or if there's anything else you're interested in learning that I can help with. I'm keen to hear!\n\n**Keep up to date with anything new from me on [my Twitter](https://twitter.com/mitchhendo_).**\n\nCheers,\n\nMitch\n\n*Thumbnail from [catapultsports.com](www.catapultsports.com).*\n",
